Play the Battleship with your computer!\n
Add your ships: one three-decker ship, two two-decker ships and four one-decker ship.\n
Enter the beginning and the end of the ship (or just the beginning for one-decker ship)\n
in format 'A1A2' or something like that. The ships shouldn't touch each other.\n
If you want to rebuild whole board, enter 'AGAIN'.\n
Empty fields are literally empty, healthy ship is \u25B2, burn ship is \u25B3,\n
and killed ship is X. Contour appear around killed ship, it's \u25E6.\n
To fire enter coordinates in the same format, 'A1'. If you miss, field becomes M.\n
You can't fire in M. You can fire in contour but what for?
